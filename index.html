    <h1>Understanding SEBI Guidelines for Investment Advisors</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Investment advisory services in India are governed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). This blog post delves into the key aspects of the engagement between a SEBI-registered investment advisor and their client, focusing on compliance, fees, and client-advisor obligations.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Key Features of the Engagement</h2>

    <h3>1. <span class="highlight">SEBI Registration and Compliance</span></h3>
    <p>
        The investment advisor is registered with SEBI under the <strong>Investment Advisers Regulations, 2013</strong>. This ensures that the advisor adheres to all legal requirements, maintaining a professional standard while providing financial advice.
    </p>

    <h3>2. <span class="highlight">Scope of Services</span></h3>
    <p>
        The advisor offers various services, such as financial planning, goal-based investment strategies, risk assessment, and portfolio recommendations, tailored to meet the client's needs and objectives.
    </p>

    <h3>3. <span class="highlight">Fee Structure</span></h3>
    <p>
        SEBI places a cap on the fees that advisors can charge, ensuring transparency and fairness:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The maximum fee is <strong>2.5% of Assets Under Advice (AUA)</strong> per year.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, a <strong>fixed fee of INR 1,25,000</strong> annually can be charged.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is as per <strong>Regulation 15A</strong> of SEBI's Investment Adviser regulations.</p>

    <h3>4. <span class="highlight">Client's Role</span></h3>
    <p>
        Clients must provide complete and accurate financial information, participate in the risk profiling process, and follow written investment advice as provided by the advisor.
    </p>

    <h3>5. <span class="highlight">Conflict of Interest & Confidentiality</span></h3>
    <p>
        Advisors must disclose any conflicts of interest as they arise and ensure that client information is kept confidential. This maintains a high level of trust and transparency in the client-advisor relationship.
    </p>

    <h3>6. <span class="highlight">Termination and Liability</span></h3>
    <p>
        Either party may terminate the engagement with a 30-day notice period. The advisor is not liable for any market losses or underperformance of investments, as long as they have adhered to SEBI regulations.
